## Missing Test Areas

### High Priority
1. **Bridge Testing** - No tests currently exist for cross-chain functionality
2. **Timelock Flow Testing** - Limited testing of governance timelock mechanisms
3. **Advanced Oracle Features** - More comprehensive quorum and fallback testing
4. **MEV Prevention** - Additional anti-sandwich and fairness mechanisms

### Medium Priority
1. **Stable Swap Enhancements** - More comprehensive stable swap invariant testing
2. **Orderbook Fairness** - Additional fairness metrics and edge case testing
3. **Lending Risk Models** - More sophisticated risk management testing
4. **Advanced AA Features** - Session key revocation, advanced paymaster scenarios

### Low Priority
1. **Edge Case Testing** - Additional edge cases for all domains
2. **Performance Testing** - Gas optimization and performance benchmarking
3. **Upgrade Edge Cases** - Complex upgrade scenarios with data migration

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Create Bridge Tests** - Implement comprehensive bridge testing suite
2. **Enhance Timelock Testing** - Add detailed timelock flow validation
3. **Expand Oracle Testing** - Add more sophisticated quorum and fallback tests
4. **Improve MEV Prevention** - Add additional anti-sandwich protection tests
5. **Performance Benchmarking** - Add gas consumption tracking and optimization tests
