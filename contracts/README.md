# Smart Contracts

This directory contains the smart contracts for the DECENTRALIZED-APP protocol.

## Directory Structure

- `core/` - Core protocol contracts
- `amm/` - Automated Market Maker contracts
- `lending/` - Lending protocol contracts
- `governance/` - Governance contracts

## Development

This directory will contain Solidity/Vyper smart contracts that implement the on-chain logic for the DECENTRALIZED-APP protocol. The contracts will be developed using Foundry or Hardhat tooling.

## Testing

Contracts will be tested using:
- Unit tests
- Fuzz tests
- Invariant tests
- Formal verification (where applicable)

## Deployment

Deployment scripts and procedures will be included to deploy contracts to various networks including:
- Local testnets
- Public testnets (Goerli, Sepolia, etc.)
- Mainnet
