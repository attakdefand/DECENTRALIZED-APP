# Smart Contract Upgradeability Patterns Implementation

This directory contains the implementation of smart contract upgradeability patterns including proxy/UUPS patterns, timelock governance, and storage layout safety.

## Overview

The upgradeability patterns implementation ensures:
- Proper proxy implementation using UUPS pattern
- Secure upgrade governance with timelock and multisig controls
- Storage layout safety to prevent data corruption
- Immutable invariants preservation across upgrades
- Integration with OpenZeppelin Upgrades plugin for validation

## Prerequisites

Before running the upgradeability tests, you need to install the following tools:

1. **Foundry**: A fast, portable, and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development
2. **Git**: For cloning dependencies

### Installing Foundry

To install Foundry, run the following command:

```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

Then restart your terminal and run:

```bash
foundryup
```

## Configuration

The upgradeability patterns implementation is built into the smart contracts themselves:
- [EnhancedUpgradeableToken.sol](src/core/EnhancedUpgradeableToken.sol): Implements comprehensive upgradeability patterns
- [TokenProxy.sol](src/core/TokenProxy.sol): Implements ERC1967 proxy standard
- [AppTimelock.sol](src/core/AppTimelock.sol): Implements timelock governance
- [GuardianMultisig.sol](src/core/GuardianMultisig.sol): Implements multisig governance

## Running Tests

### Running the Upgradeability Tests

To run the complete upgradeability tests:

```powershell
.\scripts\run-upgradeability-tests.ps1
```

This script will:
1. Run unit tests for all upgradeability patterns
2. Run integration tests for complete upgrade flows
3. Run property tests to validate invariants
4. Run edge case tests for boundary conditions
5. Run storage layout tests for compatibility
6. Run timelock tests for governance
7. Run multisig tests for decentralized control
8. Produce detailed reports

### Running Individual Tests

To run unit tests:

```bash
cd contracts
forge test --match-contract ComprehensiveUpgradeabilityTest --match-test test* -vvv
```

To run integration tests:

```bash
cd contracts
forge test --match-contract ComprehensiveUpgradeabilityTest --match-test *Integration* -vvv
```

To run property tests:

```bash
cd contracts
forge test --match-contract ComprehensiveUpgradeabilityTest --match-test testProperty* -vvv
```

To run edge case tests:

```bash
cd contracts
forge test --match-contract ComprehensiveUpgradeabilityTest --match-test *EdgeCase* -vvv
```

To run storage layout tests:

```bash
cd contracts
forge test --match-contract ComprehensiveUpgradeabilityTest --match-test *StorageLayout* -vvv
```

To run timelock tests:

```bash
cd contracts
forge test --match-contract ComprehensiveUpgradeabilityTest --match-test *Timelock* -vvv
```

To run multisig tests:

```bash
cd contracts
forge test --match-contract ComprehensiveUpgradeabilityTest --match-test *Multisig* -vvv
```

## Documentation

- [UPGRADEABILITY.md](docs/contracts/UPGRADEABILITY.md): Detailed documentation of the upgradeability patterns implementation
- [EnhancedUpgradeableToken.sol](src/core/EnhancedUpgradeableToken.sol): Contract implementing advanced upgradeability patterns
- [ComprehensiveUpgradeabilityTest.sol](test/core/ComprehensiveUpgradeabilityTest.sol): Comprehensive test suite for all upgradeability patterns

## CI/CD Integration

The upgradeability tests are integrated into GitHub Actions through the workflow file:
- [.github/workflows/contract-upgradeability.yml](.github/workflows/contract-upgradeability.yml)

This workflow:
1. Runs all upgradeability tests on every push/PR to contract files
2. Generates test reports
3. Uploads results as artifacts

## Test Results

Test results and logs are stored in the `upgradeability-results` directory after running the tests:

- Unit test logs
- Integration test logs
- Property test logs
- Edge case test logs
- Storage layout test logs
- Timelock test logs
- Multisig test logs
- Summary markdown report

## Key Upgradeability Patterns Implemented

### Proxy/UUPS Pattern

The implementation uses the Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard (UUPS) pattern:
- Minimal proxy that delegates calls to implementation
- Upgrade functionality in the implementation contract
- ERC1967 standard compliance
- Gas-efficient upgrade process

### Timelock Governance

Upgrades are gated by a timelock mechanism:
- 24 hours minimum delay for operations
- 30 days maximum delay for operations
- Role-based access control
- Specialized upgrade scheduling functions

### Multisig Governance

Upgrades require multisig approval:
- Guardian system with multiple approvers
- Configurable threshold voting
- Emergency veto power
- Formal proposal system

### Storage Layout Safety

Storage layout is carefully managed:
- Storage layout versioning
- Slot ordering for compatibility
- Validation functions
- OpenZeppelin integration

### Immutable Invariants Preservation

Critical invariants are preserved:
- Total supply invariant
- Fee invariant
- Continuous monitoring
- Pre/post upgrade validation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Foundry not found**: Ensure Foundry is installed and available in your PATH
2. **Test failures**: Review test output and contract logic
3. **Upgrade authorization failures**: Check ownership and permissions
4. **Storage layout conflicts**: Verify storage slot ordering

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the detailed logs in the upgradeability-results directory
2. Verify all prerequisites are installed
3. Ensure dependencies are properly installed
4. Consult the documentation in [UPGRADEABILITY.md](docs/contracts/UPGRADEABILITY.md)

## Contributing

To contribute to the upgradeability patterns implementation:

1. Follow the existing patterns in the contracts
2. Add new test cases to [ComprehensiveUpgradeabilityTest.sol](test/core/ComprehensiveUpgradeabilityTest.sol)
3. Update documentation as needed
4. Ensure all tests pass before submitting changes
