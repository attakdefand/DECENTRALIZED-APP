# Upgradeability Plan

This document outlines the upgradeability strategy and implementation plan for the DECENTRALIZED-APP smart contracts.

## Overview

Upgradeability is critical for maintaining and improving decentralized applications over time. This plan defines the mechanisms, processes, and safeguards for upgrading smart contracts while maintaining security and user trust.

## Upgradeability Mechanisms

### UUPS (Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard)

#### Implementation
The UUPS pattern implements upgradeability in the implementation contract itself rather than the proxy, reducing gas costs and complexity.

#### Key Components
1. **Proxy Contract**: Minimal proxy that delegates calls to implementation
2. **Implementation Contract**: Contains business logic and upgrade functionality
3. **Upgrade Function**: Secure function to update implementation address

#### Code Structure
```solidity
// Proxy contract
contract ERC1967Proxy {
    // Storage slots for implementation and admin
    bytes32 internal constant _IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT = 0x360894a13ba1a3210667c828492db98dca3e2076cc3735a920a3ca505d382bbc;
    bytes32 internal constant _ADMIN_SLOT = 0xb53127684a568b3173ae13b9f8a6016e243e63b6e8ee1178d6a717850b5d6103;
    
    constructor(address _logic, bytes memory _data) payable {
        assert(_IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT == bytes32(uint256(keccak256("eip1967.proxy.implementation")) - 1));
        assert(_ADMIN_SLOT == bytes32(uint256(keccak256("eip1967.proxy.admin")) - 1));
        _upgradeToAndCall(_logic, _data, false);
    }
    
    // ... proxy implementation
}

// Implementation contract with UUPS
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/proxy/utils/UUPSUpgradeable.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";

contract UpgradeableToken is UUPSUpgradeable, Ownable {
    // Business logic here
    
    // UUPS required function
    function _authorizeUpgrade(address newImplementation)
        internal
        override
        onlyOwner
    {}
}
```

### Transparent Proxy Pattern

#### Implementation
The transparent proxy pattern uses a proxy contract that can be upgraded by an admin and called by users.

#### Key Components
1. **Proxy Contract**: Handles delegation and admin functions
2. **Implementation Contract**: Contains business logic
3. **Admin Contract**: Manages upgrades (optional)

#### Code Structure
```solidity
// Transparent proxy
contract TransparentUpgradeableProxy is ERC1967Proxy {
    // Admin functions
    function upgradeTo(address newImplementation) external ifAdmin {
        _upgradeToAndCall(newImplementation, bytes(""), false);
    }
    
    function upgradeToAndCall(address newImplementation, bytes memory data) external payable ifAdmin {
        _upgradeToAndCall(newImplementation, data, true);
    }
    
    // User functions delegate to implementation
    // ...
}
```

## Storage Layout Management

### Storage Layout Map
Mainting consistent storage layout is critical for safe upgrades.

#### Guidelines
1. **Never reorder existing storage variables**
2. **Only append new variables at the end**
3. **Use explicit storage slot management**
4. **Document all storage changes**

#### Example Storage Layout
```solidity
// Version 1.0
contract TokenV1 {
    uint256 public totalSupply;           // slot 0
    mapping(address => uint256) balances; // slot 1 (hash-based)
    address public owner;                 // slot 2
}

// Version 2.0 - Safe upgrade
contract TokenV2 {
    uint256 public totalSupply;           // slot 0 - unchanged
    mapping(address => uint256) balances; // slot 1 - unchanged
    address public owner;                 // slot 2 - unchanged
    uint256 public newFeature;            // slot 3 - appended
}
```

### Storage Layout Diff Tool
Implement automated tools to verify storage compatibility:

```bash
# Example storage layout diff command
forge inspect TokenV1 storage-layout > v1-layout.json
forge inspect TokenV2 storage-layout > v2-layout.json
# Custom diff tool to compare layouts
```

Our implementation includes a comprehensive PowerShell-based storage layout diff tool that:
1. Extracts storage layout information from contract implementations
2. Compares layouts between versions to detect incompatibilities
3. Validates slot ordering and type compatibility
4. Generates detailed reports for review

The tool can be found at: [storage-layout-diff.ps1](../scripts/storage-layout-diff.ps1)

### Shadow-Fork Dry-Run
Before any production upgrade, we conduct shadow-fork dry-runs to validate the entire process:

1. **Isolated Environment**: Create a separate test environment that mirrors production
2. **State Cloning**: Clone the current production state
3. **Governance Simulation**: Execute the full governance flow (multisig approvals, timelock scheduling)
4. **Storage Validation**: Run storage layout compatibility checks
5. **Functionality Testing**: Verify all contract functions work correctly after upgrade
6. **Reporting**: Generate comprehensive reports documenting the process and results

The shadow-fork dry-run script can be found at: [shadow-fork-dry-run.ps1](../scripts/shadow-fork-dry-run.ps1)

## Timelock Mechanism

### Implementation
Timelocked upgrades provide a safety window for users to exit before changes take effect.

#### Key Features
1. **Minimum Delay**: Configurable delay period (e.g., 24-72 hours)
2. **Multi-signature**: Require multiple approvals for scheduling
3. **Cancellation**: Allow cancellation before execution
4. **Transparency**: Publicly visible scheduled operations

#### Code Example
```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/governance/TimelockController.sol";

contract AppTimelock is TimelockController {
    constructor(
        uint256 minDelay,
        address[] memory proposers,
        address[] memory executors
    ) TimelockController(minDelay, proposers, executors) {}
    
    // Operations can be scheduled with delay
    function scheduleUpgrade(
        address target,
        bytes memory data,
        bytes32 predecessor,
        bytes32 salt,
        uint256 delay
    ) public onlyRole(PROPOSER_ROLE) {
        schedule(target, data, predecessor, salt, delay);
    }
}
```

## Guardian Multisig

### Implementation
A guardian multisig provides an additional security layer for critical operations.

#### Key Features
1. **Multi-signature Requirement**: Require multiple signatures for critical actions
2. **Emergency Pause**: Ability to pause contracts in emergencies
3. **Upgrade Veto**: Ability to veto suspicious upgrades
4. **Key Rotation**: Secure process for changing guardians

#### Code Example
```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/AccessControl.sol";

contract GuardianMultisig is AccessControl {
    bytes32 public constant GUARDIAN_ROLE = keccak256("GUARDIAN_ROLE");
    uint256 public requiredSignatures;
    mapping(bytes32 => uint256) public proposalVotes;
    mapping(bytes32 => mapping(address => bool)) public hasVoted;
    
    constructor(uint256 _requiredSignatures) {
        requiredSignatures = _requiredSignatures;
        _setupRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender);
    }
    
    function proposeAction(bytes32 proposalId) public onlyRole(GUARDIAN_ROLE) {
        require(!hasVoted[proposalId][msg.sender], "Already voted");
        
        hasVoted[proposalId][msg.sender] = true;
        proposalVotes[proposalId] += 1;
        
        if (proposalVotes[proposalId] >= requiredSignatures) {
            executeProposal(proposalId);
        }
    }
    
    function executeProposal(bytes32 proposalId) internal {
        // Execute the proposed action
    }
}
```
