# Smart Contract Logic Patterns Implementation

This directory contains the implementation of smart contract logic patterns including CEI (Checks-Effects-Interactions), reentrancy guards, and access control mechanisms.

## Overview

The logic patterns implementation ensures:
- Proper CEI pattern adherence to prevent reentrancy attacks
- Effective reentrancy guards using OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard
- Strict access control with onlyOwner and role-based modifiers
- External calls made after state changes to maintain consistency
- Input bounds validation to prevent invalid operations
- Invariant preservation across all operations

## Prerequisites

Before running the logic patterns tests, you need to install the following tools:

1. **Foundry**: A fast, portable, and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development
2. **Git**: For cloning dependencies

### Installing Foundry

To install Foundry, run the following command:

```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

Then restart your terminal and run:

```bash
foundryup
```

## Configuration

The logic patterns implementation is built into the smart contracts themselves:
- [SafeToken.sol](src/core/SafeToken.sol): Implements CEI pattern, reentrancy guards, and access control
- [Vault.sol](src/core/Vault.sol): Implements advanced CEI pattern with withdrawal limits and emergency controls
- [UpgradeableToken.sol](src/core/UpgradeableToken.sol): Implements upgradeable token with security patterns

## Running Tests

### Running the Logic Patterns Tests

To run the complete logic patterns tests:

```powershell
.\scripts\run-logic-patterns-tests.ps1
```

This script will:
1. Run unit tests for all logic patterns
2. Run fuzz tests to validate invariants
3. Run invariant tests to ensure state consistency
4. Run Slither analysis for static security analysis
5. Produce detailed reports

### Running Individual Tests

To run unit tests:

```bash
cd contracts
forge test --match-contract LogicPatternsTest --match-test test* -vvv
```

To run fuzz tests:

```bash
cd contracts
forge test --match-contract LogicPatternsTest --match-test testProperty* -vvv
```

To run invariant tests:

```bash
cd contracts
forge test --match-contract SafetyTests --match-test test*Invariant* -vvv
```

## Documentation

- [LOGIC-PATTERNS.md](docs/contracts/LOGIC-PATTERNS.md): Detailed documentation of the logic patterns implementation
- [LogicPatternsTest.sol](test/core/LogicPatternsTest.sol): Comprehensive test suite for all logic patterns

## CI/CD Integration

The logic patterns tests are integrated into GitHub Actions through the workflow file:
- [.github/workflows/contract-logic-patterns.yml](.github/workflows/contract-logic-patterns.yml)

This workflow:
1. Runs all logic patterns tests on every push/PR to contract files
2. Performs static analysis with Slither
3. Generates test reports
4. Uploads results as artifacts

## Test Results

Test results and logs are stored in the `logic-patterns-results` directory after running the tests:

- Unit test logs
- Fuzz test logs
- Invariant test logs
- Slither analysis reports
- Summary markdown report

## Key Logic Patterns Implemented

### CEI Pattern (Checks-Effects-Interactions)

All contracts follow the CEI pattern:
1. **Checks**: All validations performed first
2. **Effects**: State changes made before external calls
3. **Interactions**: External calls happen last

### Reentrancy Guards

All vulnerable functions use the `nonReentrant` modifier:
- Token transfers
- Vault deposits and withdrawals
- Any function that modifies state and makes external calls

### Access Control

Access control is implemented using:
- `onlyOwner` modifier for owner-only functions
- `AccessControl` for role-based access where needed

### External Calls After State Write

All external calls are made after state changes:
- Using SafeERC20 for token transfers
- Following CEI pattern strictly

### Input Bounds Validation

All inputs are properly validated:
- Range checks for numeric values
- Address validation (non-zero checks)
- String and array length validation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Foundry not found**: Ensure Foundry is installed and available in your PATH
2. **Test failures**: Review test output and contract logic
3. **Slither warnings**: Address any security warnings from static analysis
4. **Reentrancy vulnerabilities**: Ensure all vulnerable functions use reentrancy guards

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the detailed logs in the logic-patterns-results directory
2. Verify all prerequisites are installed
3. Ensure dependencies are properly installed
4. Consult the documentation in [LOGIC-PATTERNS.md](docs/contracts/LOGIC-PATTERNS.md)

## Contributing

To contribute to the logic patterns implementation:

1. Follow the existing patterns in the contracts
2. Add new test cases to [LogicPatternsTest.sol](test/core/LogicPatternsTest.sol)
3. Update documentation as needed
4. Ensure all tests pass before submitting changes
