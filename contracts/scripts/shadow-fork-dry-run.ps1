## Storage Layout Analysis

The storage layout diff tool confirmed that the upgrade is safe:
- No slot reordering detected
- No incompatible type changes
- Proper variable appending for new features
- Storage layout version tracking maintained

## Conclusion

‚úÖ **Shadow-fork dry-run simulation completed successfully!**

The upgrade process was successfully simulated with all security checks passing. 
The storage layout is compatible, and the upgrade can proceed to production.

## Recommendations

1. **Run on actual testnet**: Before mainnet deployment, run the upgrade on a testnet
2. **Monitor closely**: After deployment, monitor the upgraded contracts closely
3. **Have rollback plan**: Ensure a rollback plan is ready in case of issues
4. **Communicate with users**: Inform users about the upgrade and potential downtime
