# Incident Response Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the complete implementation of incident response features for Layer 8 Observability & Detection as specified in the web3_protection_layers.csv file.

## Implementation Overview

We have successfully implemented all required incident response features for observability and detection:

### 1. Runbooks & Pager
- **Incident response runbooks** with detailed steps, communication plans, and rollback procedures
- **On-call pager configurations** with escalation policies and notification methods
- **Role-based incident response** with clear assignment of responsibilities
- **Communication paths** with multiple channels and escalation procedures

### 2. Incident Management
- **Incident creation and tracking** with severity levels and assigned personnel
- **Incident response initiation** with timestamp tracking
- **Incident resolution** with postmortem documentation
- **Mean time to recover (MTTR)** calculation for incident response metrics

### 3. Postmortem & Quality
- **Postmortem documentation** with root cause analysis and preventive measures
- **Postmortem quality tracking** with quality scores
- **Incident timeline** with detailed event logging
- **Preventive measures** to avoid recurrence

## Key Components Implemented

### ObservabilityManager
The enhanced observability manager now includes comprehensive incident response capabilities:

```rust
pub struct ObservabilityManager {
    // ... existing fields ...
    /// Incident response runbooks
    runbooks: HashMap<String, IncidentRunbook>,
    /// On-call pagers
    pagers: HashMap<String, OnCallPager>,
    /// Incidents for tracking
    incidents: Arc<Mutex<Vec<Incident>>>,
    /// Incident response statistics
    incident_stats: IncidentResponseStats,
    // ... existing fields ...
}
```

### Incident Response Features

#### Runbooks
The incident response runbooks capture all required information for incident handling:

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct IncidentRunbook {
    /// Unique identifier for the runbook
    pub id: String,
    /// Incident type the runbook addresses
    pub incident_type: String,
    /// Steps to take during the incident
    pub steps: Vec<RunbookStep>,
    /// Communication plan
    pub communication_plan: CommunicationPlan,
    /// Rollback procedures
    pub rollback_steps: Vec<String>,
    /// Estimated time to recovery
    pub estimated_recovery_time: u32, // in minutes
    /// Priority level
    pub priority: IncidentPriority,
}
```

#### Pager Configuration
The on-call pager system ensures the right people are notified:

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct OnCallPager {
    /// Unique identifier for the pager
    pub id: String,
    /// Team or service this pager is for
    pub team_service: String,
    /// Current on-call personnel
    pub on_call_personnel: Vec<OnCallPerson>,
    /// Escalation policy
    pub escalation_policy: Vec<EscalationLevel>,
    /// Notification methods
    pub notification_methods: Vec<String>,
}
```

#### Incident Tracking
The incident tracking system monitors all incidents and calculates key metrics:

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct Incident {
    /// Unique identifier for the incident
    pub id: String,
    /// Incident type
    pub incident_type: String,
    /// Timestamp when incident was detected
    pub detected_at: u64,
    /// Timestamp when incident response started
    pub response_started_at: Option<u64>,
    /// Timestamp when incident was resolved
    pub resolved_at: Option<u64>,
    /// Severity level
    pub severity: SiemSeverity,
    /// Assigned personnel
    pub assigned_personnel: Vec<String>,
    /// Runbook used
    pub runbook_id: Option<String>,
    /// Postmortem document
    pub postmortem: Option<Postmortem>,
}
```

## Tests Validation

All incident response features have been thoroughly tested:

### Functional Tests
- ✅ Runbooks & Pager functionality

## Requirements Fulfillment

### Component / Mechanism
- ✅ Who wakes up (on-call personnel identification)
- ✅ What they do (runbook steps and procedures)
- ✅ Communication path (multiple channels and escalation)
- ✅ Rollback steps (detailed rollback procedures)
- ✅ ObservabilityManager with IncidentRunbook and OnCallPager for incident response orchestration

### Goal
- ✅ Shorten incident lifetime

### Evidence / Telemetry

- ✅ Postmortem quality
- ✅ IncidentResponseStatsSnapshot with real-time incident metrics

## Usage Examples

### Creating an Observability Manager with Incident Response Capabilities
```rust
let mut manager = ObservabilityManager::new();
```

### Creating and Adding an Incident Response Runbook
```rust
let steps = vec![
    RunbookStep {
        step_number: 1,
        description: "Identify the affected systems and services".to_string(),
        responsible_role: "SRE".to_string(),
        estimated_time: 5,
        prerequisites: vec!["Incident detected".to_string()],
    },
    // ... additional steps
];

let communication_plan = CommunicationPlan {
    channels: vec![
        CommunicationChannel {
            channel_type: "slack".to_string(),
            channel_id: "incidents".to_string(),
            priority: 1,
        },
        // ... additional channels
    ],
    initial_recipients: vec!["oncall-sre@company.com".to_string()],
    escalation_paths: vec![
        EscalationPath {
            time_threshold: 30,
            recipients: vec!["manager@company.com".to_string()],
            reason: "No progress in 30 minutes".to_string(),
        },
    ],
    templates: HashMap::new(),
};

let rollback_steps = vec![
    "Restore from last known good backup".to_string(),
    "Revoke compromised credentials".to_string(),
    // ... additional rollback steps
];

let runbook = IncidentRunbook {
    id: "security-incident-response".to_string(),
    incident_type: "security-breach".to_string(),
    steps,
    communication_plan,
    rollback_steps,
    estimated_recovery_time: 60,
    priority: IncidentPriority::Critical,
};

assert!(manager.add_runbook(runbook).is_ok());
```

### Creating and Adding an On-Call Pager Configuration
```rust
let mut contact_info = HashMap::new();
contact_info.insert("email".to_string(), "sre-oncall@company.com".to_string());
contact_info.insert("phone".to_string(), "+1-555-0123".to_string());

let on_call_person = OnCallPerson {
    user_id: "sre-001".to_string(),
    name: "Alice Smith".to_string(),
    contact_info,
    time_zone: "UTC-5".to_string(),
};

let escalation_policy = vec![
    EscalationLevel {
        level: 1,
        delay_minutes: 5,
        personnel: vec!["sre-001".to_string()],
    },
    // ... additional escalation levels
];

let pager = OnCallPager {
    id: "sre-pager".to_string(),
    team_service: "sre-team".to_string(),
    on_call_personnel: vec![on_call_person],
    escalation_policy,
    notification_methods: vec!["slack".to_string(), "sms".to_string(), "email".to_string()],
};

assert!(manager.add_pager(pager).is_ok());
```

### Creating and Managing Incidents
```rust
// Create an incident
let incident_id = manager.create_incident(
    "security-breach".to_string(),
    SiemSeverity::Critical,
    vec!["sre-001".to_string()],
    Some("security-incident-response".to_string()),
).expect("Failed to create incident");

// Start incident response
assert!(manager.start_incident_response(&incident_id).is_ok());

// Resolve incident with postmortem
let postmortem = Postmortem {
    summary: "Security breach resolved".to_string(),
    root_cause: "Misconfigured firewall rule".to_string(),
    timeline: vec![], // ... timeline events
    impact: "Minimal service disruption".to_string(),
    resolution: "Fixed firewall configuration".to_string(),
    preventive_measures: vec![
        "Add firewall configuration validation".to_string(),
        "Improve monitoring".to_string(),
    ],
    quality_score: 90,
};

assert!(manager.resolve_incident(&incident_id, Some(postmortem)).is_ok());
```

### Retrieving Incident Response Metrics
```rust
// Get MTTR statistics
let (resolved_count, mttr) = manager.get_mttr_stats();
println!("Resolved incidents: {}", resolved_count);
println!("Mean time to recover: {:.2} seconds", mttr);

// Get postmortem quality statistics
let (postmortem_count, avg_quality) = manager.get_postmortem_quality_stats();
println!("Postmortem entries: {}", postmortem_count);
println!("Average quality score: {:.1}", avg_quality);
```
