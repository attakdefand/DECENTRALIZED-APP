# Resilience and Availability Protection Layer

This document describes the resilience and availability protection layer implemented in the decentralized application.

## Overview

The resilience and availability protection layer ensures that the decentralized application can survive node/zone loss and maintain high availability through various mechanisms including:

1. **High Availability (HA) and Failover**
2. **Traffic Protection**
3. **Graceful Degradation**
4. **Disaster Recovery**

## Components

### 1. High Availability (HA) and Failover

The HA/failover component provides redundancy through:

- Multi-AZ deployment
- Load balancer health checks
- Replicas per service

**Goal**: Survive node/zone loss
**Evidence/Telemetry**: Failover event logs, uptime %

### 2. Traffic Protection

The traffic protection component includes:

- Circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures
- Bulkheads for resource isolation
- Rate shaping to manage traffic flow

**Goal**: Protect core systems during incidents
**Evidence/Telemetry**: Breaker open/close timeline, shed %

### 3. Graceful Degradation

The graceful degradation component allows the system to:

- Serve cached data when primary systems are down
- Operate in read-only mode during maintenance
- Maintain partial service availability

**Goal**: Keep partial service alive
**Evidence/Telemetry**: Time spent in degraded mode vs full outage

### 4. Disaster Recovery

The disaster recovery component provides:

- DR playbooks for recovery procedures
- Chaos testing to validate resilience
- RPO/RTO tracking for recovery objectives

**Goal**: Know we can recover under stress
**Evidence/Telemetry**: Chaos test reports, RTO achieved

## Implementation Details

### Core Module

The core functionality is implemented in the `resilience_availability` module in the `core` crate:

- `ResilienceAvailabilityManager`: Main manager for resilience and availability features
- `ServiceInstance`: Represents a service instance for HA/failover
- `CircuitBreaker`: Implements circuit breaker pattern for service protection
- `Bulkhead`: Implements bulkhead pattern for resource isolation
- `HaFailoverConfig`: Configuration for HA/failover
- `TrafficProtectionConfig`: Configuration for traffic protection
- `GracefulDegradationConfig`: Configuration for graceful degradation
- `DisasterRecoveryConfig`: Configuration for disaster recovery

### Kubernetes Configuration

The resilience and availability features are configured through Kubernetes ConfigMaps:

- HA/failover configuration
- Traffic protection configuration
- Graceful degradation configuration
- Disaster recovery configuration

## Testing

The resilience and availability features are tested through:

1. **Unit Tests**: Located in `crates/core/tests/resilience_availability_integration.rs`
2. **Simulation Tests**: Located in `tests/resilience_availability_simulation.rs`
3. **Binary Tests**: Located in `crates/core/src/bin/resilience_availability_simulation.rs`

### Running Tests

To run the resilience and availability tests:

```bash
# Run unit tests
cargo test --package core --test resilience_availability_integration

# Run simulation tests
cargo run --package core --bin resilience_availability_simulation

# Run integration tests
cargo test --test resilience_availability_simulation
```

Or use the provided script:

```bash
./scripts/run-resilience-availability-tests.bat
```

## Monitoring and Telemetry

The resilience and availability layer provides telemetry through:

- Failover event logs
- Uptime percentage tracking
- Circuit breaker state changes
- Bulkhead saturation events
- Feature flag usage

This telemetry is used to monitor system health and identify potential issues before they impact users.
