Love this one. CodeQL is a big deal for serious security + compliance pipelines, so let's map it fully in your style: main types → sub types → components → how it fits your CI/CD and 22-layer security model.

We'll treat CodeQL like a full platform, not just “a scanner”.

---

## 0. What is CodeQL (at your level)

CodeQL is a code analysis engine that:

* Turns your source code into a queryable database (like SQL but for code).
* Runs security queries to find vulnerabilities (known patterns + custom rules).
* Lets you write new queries that match your own policies and banned behavior.
* Can run on pull request, on main branch, and across your whole history.

So in your pipeline it is:

* Secure SDLC guard
* Policy enforcement gate
* Evidence generator for audits

## 1. Main Feature Areas (Top Level Types)

1. **CodeQL Database & Extractor**
2. **Query Engine & Query Packs**
3. **Security Analysis / Vulnerability Detection**
4. **Custom Rule Authoring / Governance**
5. **CI/CD Integration / Dev Workflow**
6. **Results, Triage & Audit Evidence**
7. **Ecosystem / Language Coverage**
8. **Scaling & Optimization for Big Repos/Monorepos**

Now we go deep in each.

---

## 1. CodeQL Database & Extractor

This is how CodeQL “understands” your code.

### 1.1 Source Extraction

* **Supported languages (built-in extractors)**:

  * C/C++
  * C#
  * Go
  * Java / Kotlin (JVM languages)
  * JavaScript / TypeScript
  * Python
  * Ruby
  * Swift
  * (Plus some infra-as-code / experimental in the ecosystem)
* Extractor parses source, build graphs, resolves types, data flow, call graph, etc.

### 1.2 CodeQL DB (the snapshot)

* A CodeQL DB is a structured dataset representing:

  * AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)
  * Control Flow Graph
  * Data Flow Graph
  * Type information
  * Taint steps and sinks
  * Call graph / interprocedural relationships
* You generate one DB per language per repo or per build target.
* You can store these DBs and re-run queries later without rebuilding.

### 1.3 Build Modes

* **Autobuild mode**: CodeQL tries to build the project automatically using defaults (e.g. `mvn`, `gradle`, `npm`, `go build`).
* **Manual build mode**: You run your own build steps (useful for complex Rust-style multi-service layouts later if/when Rust is supported officially).
* **Query-on-snapshot mode**: You can generate the DB from a past commit and run regression scans historically.

➡ Why this matters for you:
This DB is the “evidence artifact” for audit in your 22-layer security governance. You can prove “we scanned commit X with ruleset Y”.

---

## 2. Query Engine & Query Packs

### 2.1 Query Engine

* Runs CodeQL queries (QL language).
* Supports joins, flow steps, pattern matches across the entire code graph.
* Can detect “does value from untrusted source reach dangerous sink without sanitizer?”

### 2.2 Query Packs

A pack = bundle of queries + metadata.
Types of packs:

* **Standard Security Packs**

  * Common vulns: SQL injection, RCE, deserialization bugs, XXE, path traversal, SSRF, etc.
  * Mapped to CWEs (Common Weakness Enumeration).
* **Quality/Bug Packs**

  * Dead code
  * Null deref
  * Useless conditions
  * Resource leaks
* **Custom Org Pack**

  * Your internal banned patterns
  * Your crypto rules
  * Your unsafe macro rules (later for Rust)
  * Your permission checks

### 2.3 Query Tuning / Performance

* Packs can be scoped to “fast” (PR scan) vs “deep” (nightly).
* Packs can be versioned, so you can lock policy for compliance: “We use SecurityPack v4.2 in prod”.

## 3. Security Analysis / Vulnerability Detection

This is what most people think CodeQL does, but we'll break it into sub types.

### 3.1 Taint Tracking

* Tracks flow of “untrusted input” → “dangerous sink”.
* Example:

  * Request body → string concat → SQL query exec.
* You can define:

  * Sources (user-supplied, env vars, blockchain calldata, etc.)
  * Sinks (db.execute, filesystem write, shell exec, external call)
  * Sanitizers (validation, escaping, allowlist function)

This is CRITICAL for you because you have:

* API gateway → internal microservice → DB write
* DEX smart order routers → swap executor → settlement
* Any place where attacker-controlled data touches money

### 3.2 Known CWE Patterns

* Hard-coded secrets
* Command injection
* Insecure deserialization
* SSRF
* Open redirect
* Weak crypto usage (MD5/SHA1/etc.)
* Insecure random (Math.random() instead of crypto RNG)
* Insecure file perms
* Unsafe reflection / dynamic eval

These map to your Security Layer:

* AppSec
* Secrets management
* Crypto policy
* Input validation / boundary defense

### 3.3 Framework-specific Rules

* Django/Flask sanitization mistakes
* Spring Boot insecure endpoints
* Express.js unsafely concatenated routes
* React server-side rendering injection patterns
* (In crypto context: unsafe call of `delegatecall` in Solidity — note: Solidity is primarily linted with other tools, but CodeQL community has some experimental work; official Solidity coverage is not first-class like JS/Java yet)

### 3.4 Supply Chain / Dependency Use

* Use of deprecated or vulnerable APIs inside your code.
* Using libraries in insecure ways (like insecure TLS config).
* Dangerous deserialization gadgets from known libs.

---

## 4. Custom Rule Authoring / Governance

This is where CodeQL becomes YOUR policy gate.

### 4.1 Custom Queries

You write `.ql` files that say:

* “Every call to `spawn_unrestricted_shell()` is forbidden.”
* “Every external HTTP call must include `X-Risk-Header`.”
* “Every state-changing function must check `onlyOwner()` first.”

For you:

* “Every DEX order execution that touches balances must call `risk_check()` before settlement.”
* “No service can call `transfer_funds()` without an audit log write.”

You basically weaponize CodeQL to enforce your business and compliance rules, not just generic OWASP.

### 4.2 Query Libraries

* You can build helper libraries in QL (like “isUserInput(value)” or “isDangerousSink(node)”).
* Reuse across repos (API service, Orderbook service, Withdrawal service, etc.)

### 4.3 Policy-as-code

This connects to your Layer 1 “Governance & Policy”.

* You can say: “This query = control RISK-9.1 Withdrawal Approval Check”.
* You keep the `.ql` file in `/policy/ql/withdrawal/approval_required.ql`.
* So CodeQL scan result = evidence that control RISK-9.1 is enforced.

### 4.4 Severity & Categorization

You control:

* `severity`: error / warning / note
* `precision`: high / medium / low (confidence)
* `tags`: `security`, `compliance`, `dex-withdrawal-policy`, etc.
  This lets you wire “block merge if severity=error”.

---

## 5. CI/CD Integration / Dev Workflow

This part is how it runs in your pipeline.

### 5.1 Pull Request Scan (Developer Feedback Loop)

* Trigger: every PR.
* Actions:

  * Build project (or autobuild).
  * Generate CodeQL DB.
  * Run “fast pack” (high-confidence, quick queries).
  * Comment findings directly on diff lines.

Goal: stop new vulnerabilities from entering.

### 5.2 Main Branch / Nightly Deep Scan

* Broader query packs (more expensive queries).
* Full taint tracking across service boundaries.
* Historical diff: “Did we introduce any NEW critical findings since yesterday?”

Goal: regression + trend over time.

### 5.3 Break-the-build / Gatekeeping

Merge is blocked if:

* Critical vuln found
* Compliance rule broken
* “Forbidden API call” triggered
* “No RBAC check” in sensitive function

This is literally your “CD promotion gate”.
In your language: this is the “security gate between CI and CD”.

### 5.4 Multi-repo / Microservice Monorepo

* You can run CodeQL per service (`auth-service`, `withdrawal-service`, `matching-engine`, etc.).
* Or run it once at top-level (monorepo model).
* You can publish shared query packs so ALL services inherit the same security rules.

### 5.5 Baseline / Alert Only on NEW Issues

You can “accept” existing tech debt and only fail the pipeline if new issues appear. This is important in legacy code or imported open source modules.

---

## 6. Results, Triage & Audit Evidence

### 6.1 Findings Dashboard

Each finding includes:

* Severity
* CWE ID
* File + line
* Code snippet
* Data flow trace (source → sink path)
* Suggested fix / reasoning

That trace is gold for reviewers and auditors because it shows exploit path, not just “this line bad”.

### 6.2 Alert Lifecycle

* Mark false positive
* Mark as “fixed in PR #123”
* Mark as “accepted risk until 2025-12-31” (with owner)

This ties into:

* Governance layer: Exception Management
* Audit layer: “Who approved this temporary risk?”

### 6.3 Evidence Storage

You export:

* Scan report (JSON, SARIF)
* Query pack version used
* Commit hash
* Reviewer decision

Your auditor loves this because now security is provable, signed, timestamped.

### 6.4 Metrics / KPIs

Good KPIs to track:

* Time-to-remediate criticals
* # of new criticals per week
* % of services passing “no high vulns”
* % of PRs scanned with CodeQL
  Maps to your SLO-style security SLAs.

---

## 7. Ecosystem / Language Coverage

### 7.1 First-class languages

Strong, mature rulesets:

* Java / Kotlin
* JavaScript / TypeScript
* Python
* Go
* C/C++
* C#
* Ruby
* Swift

These languages already have deep taint tracking libraries, known CWE models, etc.

### 7.2 Infra / IaC / Scripts

Some orgs use CodeQL in creative/experimental ways against:

* Terraform-like configs
* Shell scripts
* YAML policy / pipeline configs
  This is more custom, but it’s used in real orgs to enforce infra policy (e.g. “no public S3 bucket”).

### 7.3 Rust

As of my last full internal training cutoff (June 2024) there wasn't official first-class Rust support in CodeQL. Some community/experimental extractors exist, and people also enforce Rust policies using `cargo deny`, `clippy` rules, or custom static analyzers. You can still integrate CodeQL for your TypeScript gateway, Python admin tools, Go services, etc., and separately enforce Rust security with Rust-native tools. We can mirror the CodeQL pattern in Rust using clippy + custom lint crates.

This means: for your ecosystem you likely run:

* CodeQL for TS admin dashboard / Node gateway / Python workers
* Rust security rules via clippy + custom lints + cargo audit + cargo deny
* Smart contract rules via Slither / Echidna / custom fuzz
  And then report them together as “Secure SDLC static checks”.

## 8. Scaling & Optimization

### 8.1 Incremental / Diff Scanning

Only analyze files that changed + related flow. Faster.

### 8.2 Parallelization

Sharding by language / module / service.
Run scans in parallel jobs in CI.

### 8.3 Central Query Registry

Store your org’s query packs in one repo and version them.
All microservices import that as a dependency.
Benefit:

* Change the rule in ONE place → all services adopt it next pipeline run.

### 8.4 Security Tiering

You can define:

* Tier 0 (money movement code): must pass ALL critical rules
* Tier 1 (read-only analytics): can ship with warnings
  This matches your risk engine for settlement, withdrawal, custody, fee calc, etc.

## How this fits your world (DEX + Sniping Bot + 22 Layers)

* Layer: **Secure SDLC & Supply Chain**

  * CodeQL enforces that every PR is scanned with approved security packs.
* Layer: **Access Control / Authorization**

  * You write a custom rule: “Any external withdrawal function must call `check_user_limits()`”.
* Layer: **Compliance / Audit / Governance**

  * CodeQL SARIF + commit hash becomes permanent signed proof that you ran policy checks before deploy.
* Layer: **Abuse / Fraud / Risk**

  * You write queries for “bypass limit”, “direct ledger mutation without journal”, “transfer without KYC check”.
  * That’s not generic security, that’s business risk protection.

So CodeQL is not just “find SQL injection”.
You turn it into “nobody can silently steal from the ledger”.
