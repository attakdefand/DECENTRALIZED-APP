Short answer: **lay the *foundational security layers first*** (they shape architecture and keys), **then use testing types to prove them**—but set up a *minimal test harness on day one* so nothing ships untested.

Here’s a no-nonsense order you can follow:

# 0) Same-day setup (do both, tiny but mandatory)

* **Security layers (baseline):** repo policies, key custody (multisig/MPC), CEI + reentrancy guard, pausability/timelock, policy for upgrades.
* **Testing types (baseline):** unit tests, fuzz for critical math, gas snapshot, static analysis (Slither), CI to run on every PR.

# 1) Foundation first (security layers that architect everything)

1. **Governance & keys:** multisig/MPC, timelock, pause/kill, CODEOWNERS.
2. **Identity & access:** RBAC/roles on contracts; OPA/Cedar for service configs.
3. **Smart-contract safety patterns:** CEI, input bounds, rate limits, circuit breaker.
4. **Protocol economics guardrails:** parameter bounds, oracle sanity checks.

> Rationale: these choices are **hard to change later** and define what your tests must assert.

# 2) Immediately after: expand the test suite around those layers

* **Property/invariant tests** (value conservation, monotonicity, no stuck funds).
* **Stateful fuzz** (AMM curves, lending health factor, auction clearing).
* **Upgrade/storage-layout checks** (proxy/UUPS).
* **Oracle manipulation tests** (TWAP/median, staleness/outliers).
* **Replay/front-run sims** (commit-reveal/FBA/private orderflow claims).

# 3) Next security layers (platform & ops hardening)

* **Supply chain & CI** (SBOM, cosign, reproducible builds).
* **Infra & runtime** (K8s admission, seccomp/AppArmor, secrets mgmt).
* **Network/RPC strategy** (multi-provider, failover, TLS pinning).
* **Observability & audit** (OTel traces, Prom/Loki/Tempo, tamper-evident admin log).

# 4) Broaden testing types to match real-world risk

* **Performance & scale:** throughput/latency, gas budgets, soak.
* **Reliability & chaos:** RPC/DB/IPFS failure drills, reorg tolerance.
* **E2E UX & wallet tests:** slippage/deadline enforcement, chain switch UX.
* **Cross-chain/bridge tests (if applicable):** proof verification, challenge windows, replay prevention.
* **Privacy/ZK tests:** membership/nullifier correctness, revocation.

# 5) Pre-mainnet gate (apply both together)

* **Security layers:** bug bounty live, incident runbooks, insurance/treasury rules, compliance pages.
* **Testing:** shadow-fork runs, adversarial economic sims, bytecode diff + signed release artifacts.

## Simple rule of thumb

* **Architectural controls (security layers) lead;** they define what “safe” means.
* **Verification (testing types) follows and runs forever;** they prove “safe is true today” on every commit and after every upgrade.
