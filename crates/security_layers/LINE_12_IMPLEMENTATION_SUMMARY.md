# Application Security Business Logic Controls Implementation Summary (Line 12)

## Overview

This document summarizes the complete implementation and testing of the Application Security Business Logic Controls features from line 12 of the web3_protection_layers.csv file:

```
3,Application Security,Business Logic Controls,Rate/Velocity Rules,"OTP retry limits, withdrawal limits, anti-bruteforce counters, anti-spam throttles","Stop abuse of legit flows","Per-user throttle hits, lockouts"
```

## Features Implemented

### 1. OTP Retry Limits
- Configurable limits on OTP (One-Time Password) retry attempts
- Time-window based rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks
- Automatic blocking of excessive retry attempts

### 2. Withdrawal Limits
- Configurable limits on withdrawal amounts
- Time-window based rate limiting to prevent excessive withdrawals
- Value-based limiting to prevent financial abuse

### 3. Anti-Bruteforce Counters
- Configurable limits on login attempts
- Automatic user lockout after excessive failed attempts
- Configurable lockout duration

### 4. Anti-Spam Throttles
- Configurable limits on request rates
- Time-window based rate limiting to prevent spam
- Automatic blocking of excessive requests

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

1. **BusinessLogicControls** - Main struct for business logic controls
2. **RateLimiter** - Generic rate limiter for different operations
3. **WindowedCounter** - Time-window based counter implementation
4. **UserCounter** - User-specific counter for tracking throttle hits
5. **LockoutManager** - Manager for temporarily blocking abusive users

### Key Methods

- `configure_otp_retry_limits()` - Set OTP retry limits
- `configure_withdrawal_limits()` - Set withdrawal limits
- `configure_bruteforce_protection()` - Set bruteforce protection limits
- `configure_spam_throttles()` - Set spam throttle limits
- `check_otp_retry_allowed()` - Check if OTP retry is allowed
- `check_withdrawal_allowed()` - Check if withdrawal is allowed
- `check_login_allowed()` - Check if login attempt is allowed
- `check_request_allowed()` - Check if request is allowed
- `get_throttle_hit_count()` - Get throttle hit count for a user and rule
- `get_user_throttle_hits()` - Get all throttle hit counts for a user
- `is_user_locked_out()` - Check if a user is locked out
- `reset_user_counters()` - Reset counters for a user

## Testing

### Unit Tests
All core functionality is thoroughly tested:
- OTP retry limits
- Withdrawal limits
- Anti-bruteforce counters
- Anti-spam throttles
- User counter reset
- Throttle hit tracking

### Integration Tests
- Comprehensive validation of all Business Logic Controls features
- Testing of the specific requirements from line 12 of web3_protection_layers.csv
- Verification of abuse prevention capabilities
- Demonstration of evidence/telemetry collection

## Security Features

### Abuse Prevention
- **OTP Retry Limits** - Prevent brute-force attacks on OTP systems
- **Withdrawal Limits** - Prevent financial abuse through excessive withdrawals
- **Anti-Bruteforce Counters** - Prevent credential stuffing and brute-force attacks
- **Anti-Spam Throttles** - Prevent spam and DoS attacks

### Evidence & Telemetry Collection
- **Per-user throttle hits** - Track abuse attempts per user
- **Lockouts** - Track user lockout events

## Usage Examples

```rust
use security_layers::application_security::BusinessLogicControls;

// Create business logic controls instance
let mut controls = BusinessLogicControls::new();

// Configure OTP retry limits (3 attempts per minute)
controls.configure_otp_retry_limits(3, 60);

// Configure withdrawal limits ($1000 per hour)
controls.configure_withdrawal_limits(1000.0, 3600);

// Configure bruteforce protection (3 attempts per minute, 5 min lockout)
controls.configure_bruteforce_protection(3, 60, 300);

// Configure spam throttles (5 requests per minute)
controls.configure_spam_throttles(5, 60);

// Check if OTP retry is allowed
match controls.check_otp_retry_allowed("user123") {
    Ok(()) => println!("OTP retry allowed"),
    Err(e) => println!("OTP retry blocked: {}", e),
}

// Check if withdrawal is allowed
match controls.check_withdrawal_allowed("user123", 500.0) {
    Ok(()) => println!("Withdrawal allowed"),
    Err(e) => println!("Withdrawal blocked: {}", e),
}

// Check if login is allowed
match controls.check_login_allowed("user123") {
    Ok(()) => println!("Login allowed"),
    Err(e) => println!("Login blocked: {}", e),
}

// Get throttle hit counts
let otp_hits = controls.get_throttle_hit_count("user123", "otp_retry");
let spam_hits = controls.get_throttle_hit_count("user123", "spam");
println!("User had {} OTP throttle hits and {} spam throttle hits", otp_hits, spam_hits);

// Check if user is locked out
if controls.is_user_locked_out("user123") {
    println!("User is currently locked out");
}
```

## Compliance

This implementation satisfies all requirements from line 12 of web3_protection_layers.csv:
- ✅ OTP retry limits
- ✅ Withdrawal limits
- ✅ Anti-bruteforce counters
- ✅ Anti-spam throttles
- ✅ Stop abuse of legit flows
- ✅ Per-user throttle hits, lockouts

## Future Enhancements

1. Integration with external monitoring and alerting systems
2. Additional business logic controls for other abuse patterns
3. Performance optimizations for high-throughput applications
4. Enhanced telemetry with detailed abuse pattern analysis
5. Integration with machine learning-based anomaly detection
