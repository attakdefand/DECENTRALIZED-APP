# Data-at-Rest Encryption Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the complete implementation of the "Data-at-Rest" security layer with "Encryption at Rest" functionality as specified in the web3_protection_layers.csv file.

## CSV Requirements
From the CSV file:
- **Layer**: 5, Data Security
- **Main Type**: Data-at-Rest
- **Sub Type**: Encryption at Rest
- **Component/Mechanism**: "KMS-managed disk/volume/db encryption, envelope encryption for fields like PII"
- **Goal**: "Protect data if disk/db is stolen"
- **Evidence/Telemetry**: "Key rotation logs, KMS access logs"

## Implementation Details

### 1. Core Data Structures
- **DataAtRestConfig**: Configuration struct for Data-at-Rest encryption settings
- **KeyRotationLog**: Log entry for key rotation events
- **KmsAccessLog**: Log entry for KMS access events
- **DataAtRestManager**: Central manager for Data-at-Rest operations and telemetry

### 2. Security Features
- **KMS-managed Encryption**: Integration with Key Management Service for secure key management
- **Envelope Encryption**: Two-layer encryption for sensitive fields like PII
- **Key Rotation**: Automated key rotation with configurable intervals
- **Access Control**: Detailed logging of all KMS access operations

### 3. Telemetry and Evidence Collection
- **Key Rotation Logging**: Detailed logs of all key rotation events including:
  - Timestamp
  - Key identifiers
  - Rotation reasons
  - Success/failure status
- **KMS Access Logging**: Comprehensive logs of all KMS operations including:
  - Timestamp
  - Key identifiers
  - Operation types (encrypt, decrypt, etc.)
  - Success/failure status
  - Accessing services/users

### 4. Compliance with Requirements
- ✅ **KMS-managed disk/volume/db encryption**: Implemented with KMS integration
- ✅ **Envelope encryption for fields like PII**: Implemented with two-layer encryption
- ✅ **Protect data if disk/db is stolen**: Achieved through strong encryption
- ✅ **Key rotation logs**: Comprehensive logging of all key rotations
- ✅ **KMS access logs**: Detailed audit trail of all KMS operations

## Testing
Comprehensive test suite validates:
- DataAtRestConfig creation and validation
- KeyRotationLog and KmsAccessLog functionality
- DataAtRestManager operations
- Configuration updates
- Key rotation and KMS access logging
- Telemetry report generation
- Integration with overall security layers

## Usage Example
The implementation provides a complete framework for securing all data at rest with:
1. Strong encryption (AES-256-GCM)
2. KMS-managed key security
3. Envelope encryption for sensitive data
4. Automated key rotation
5. Comprehensive logging for audit and monitoring
6. Easy integration with existing services

This implementation fully satisfies the requirements specified in the CSV file for Layer 5, Data Security, Data-at-Rest with Encryption at Rest.
