## Key Features Demonstrated

### TLS (Data-in-Transit)
- TLS 1.2+ enforcement
- HTTPS mandatory for all connections
- HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)
- Mutual TLS (mTLS) for service-to-service authentication
- Certificate rotation management
- Comprehensive logging for audit trails
- Telemetry reporting

### Data-at-Rest Encryption
- KMS-managed encryption for disk/volume/database
- Envelope encryption for sensitive fields like PII
- Key rotation management
- KMS access control and monitoring
- Comprehensive logging for audit trails
- Telemetry reporting

### Data Minimization
- Store only required attributes to minimize data exposure
- Redact PII in logs to prevent sensitive information exposure
- Tokenize high-risk values to protect them even if data is breached
- Scan logs for PII to generate evidence/telemetry
- Comprehensive reporting for audit trails

### Backup & Restore
- Periodic encrypted snapshots to ensure recent backups exist
- Offline copies to protect against ransomware
- Tested restore drills to ensure actual restore capability
- Comprehensive metrics collection (RPO/RTO)
- Telemetry reporting for compliance

## Security Goals Achieved

### TLS (Data-in-Transit)
- **Prevention of Sniffing**: All data in transit is encrypted
- **Prevention of MITM Attacks**: Mutual authentication ensures only trusted parties communicate
- **Compliance**: Implementation meets all requirements from the security specification

### Data-at-Rest Encryption
- **Data Protection**: All data at rest is encrypted using strong encryption algorithms
- **Key Management**: Secure key management through KMS integration
- **Compliance**: Implementation meets all requirements from the security specification

### Data Minimization
- **Breach Impact Reduction**: Minimize the amount of data stored and exposed
- **PII Protection**: Prevent sensitive information from being exposed in logs
- **High-Risk Value Protection**: Protect critical values through tokenization
- **Compliance**: Implementation meets all requirements from the security specification

### Backup & Restore
- **Ransomware Protection**: Offline copies protect against ransomware attacks
- **Data Loss Prevention**: Periodic snapshots ensure recent backups exist
- **Recovery Assurance**: Tested restore drills ensure actual restore capability
- **Compliance**: Implementation meets all requirements from the security specification
