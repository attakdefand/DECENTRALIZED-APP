# Backup & Restore Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive summary of the implementation of Backup & Restore with Signed/Encrypted Backups as part of Layer 5: Data Security from the Web3 protection layers matrix. This implementation satisfies the requirements specified in the `web3_protection_layers.csv` file:

- **Component / Mechanism**: "Periodic encrypted snapshots, offline copy, tested restore drill"
- **Goal**: "Survive ransomware / data loss"
- **Evidence / Telemetry**: "Successful restore drill evidence, RPO/RTO metrics"

## Implementation Details

### Backup & Restore Configuration

The implementation provides a comprehensive configuration system for Backup & Restore:

#### BackupRestoreConfig Struct

The `BackupRestoreConfig` struct represents the configuration for Backup & Restore:

```rust
pub struct BackupRestoreConfig {
    /// Whether to enable periodic encrypted snapshots
    pub periodic_snapshots_enabled: bool,
    /// Snapshot interval in seconds
    pub snapshot_interval: u64,
    /// Whether to maintain offline copies
    pub offline_copy_enabled: bool,
    /// Whether to perform restore drills
    pub restore_drill_enabled: bool,
    /// Encryption algorithm for backups
    pub encryption_algorithm: String,
    /// Retention period for backups in days
    pub retention_days: u32,
}
```

### Core Components

#### BackupRestoreManager

The `BackupRestoreManager` struct is the central manager for Backup & Restore operations:

```rust
pub struct BackupRestoreManager {
    /// Backup & Restore configuration
    config: BackupRestoreConfig,
    /// Backup snapshots
    snapshots: Vec<BackupSnapshot>,
    /// Restore drill reports
    drill_reports: Vec<RestoreDrillReport>,
}
```

#### BackupSnapshot

The `BackupSnapshot` struct represents a backup snapshot:

```rust
pub struct BackupSnapshot {
    /// Unique identifier for the snapshot
    pub id: String,
    /// Timestamp of creation
    pub created_at: u64,
    /// Backup location (encrypted)
    pub location: String,
    /// Size in bytes
    pub size: u64,
    /// Whether the backup is signed
    pub is_signed: bool,
    /// Whether the backup is encrypted
    pub is_encrypted: bool,
    /// Backup type
    pub backup_type: BackupType,
    /// Status of the backup
    pub status: BackupStatus,
}
```

#### RestoreDrillReport

The `RestoreDrillReport` struct represents a report generated by performing restore drills:

```rust
pub struct RestoreDrillReport {
    /// Timestamp of the drill
    pub timestamp: u64,
    /// Whether the drill was successful
    pub success: bool,
    /// Restore Point Objective (RPO) achieved in seconds
    pub rpo_achieved: u64,
    /// Restore Time Objective (RTO) achieved in seconds
    pub rto_achieved: u64,
    /// Error message if drill failed
    pub error_message: Option<String>,
    /// Metrics from the drill
    pub metrics: RestoreMetrics,
}
```

#### BackupType Enum

The `BackupType` enum represents different types of backups:

```rust
pub enum BackupType {
    /// Full database backup
    Database,
    /// Configuration backup
    Configuration,
    /// State backup
    State,
    /// Keys backup
    Keys,
}
```

#### BackupStatus Enum

The `BackupStatus` enum represents the status of backups:

```rust
pub enum BackupStatus {
    /// Backup is pending
    Pending,
    /// Backup is in progress
    InProgress,
    /// Backup completed successfully
    Completed,
    /// Backup failed
    Failed,
}
```

### Features

#### 1. Periodic Encrypted Snapshots
- ✅ Configuration option to enable periodic encrypted snapshots
- ✅ Configurable snapshot intervals
- ✅ All snapshots are signed and encrypted
- ✅ Support for different backup types (Database, Configuration, State, Keys)
- ✅ Automatic retention management

#### 2. Offline Copy
- ✅ Configuration option to enable offline copies
- ✅ Creation of offline copies for ransomware protection
- ✅ Secure offline storage locations

#### 3. Tested Restore Drill
- ✅ Configuration option to enable restore drills
- ✅ Automated restore drill execution
- ✅ Comprehensive metrics collection during drills
- ✅ Success/failure tracking

#### 4. Goal Achievement: "Survive ransomware / data loss"
- ✅ All three mechanisms work together to ensure data survival
- ✅ Periodic encrypted snapshots ensure recent backups exist
- ✅ Offline copies ensure backups can't be affected by ransomware
- ✅ Tested restore drills ensure actual restore capability

#### 5. Evidence/Telemetry: "Successful restore drill evidence, RPO/RTO metrics"
- ✅ Comprehensive restore drill reporting
- ✅ Detailed RPO (Restore Point Objective) metrics
- ✅ Detailed RTO (Restore Time Objective) metrics
- ✅ Historical tracking of drill reports
- ✅ Telemetry generation for audit and compliance

## Testing

## Usage Example

The implementation provides a complete framework for Backup & Restore with:

1. Configurable Backup & Restore settings
2. Periodic encrypted snapshot creation
3. Offline copy generation for ransomware protection

### Example Usage

```rust
use security_layers::data_security::{
    BackupRestoreConfig, BackupType, BackupRestoreManager,
};

// Create configuration
let config = BackupRestoreConfig {
    periodic_snapshots_enabled: true,
    snapshot_interval: 3600, // 1 hour
    offline_copy_enabled: true,
    restore_drill_enabled: true,
    encryption_algorithm: "AES-256-GCM".to_string(),
    retention_days: 30,
};

// Create manager
let mut manager = BackupRestoreManager::new(config);

// Create periodic encrypted snapshots
let snapshot = manager.create_snapshot(BackupType::Database)?;

// Create offline copy
let offline_location = manager.create_offline_copy(&snapshot.id)?;

// Perform restore drill
let drill_report = manager.perform_restore_drill();

// Generate telemetry report
let telemetry_report = manager.generate_telemetry_report();
```

This implementation fully satisfies the requirements specified in the CSV file for Layer 5, Data Security, Backup & Restore with Signed/Encrypted Backups.
