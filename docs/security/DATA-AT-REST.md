# Data-at-Rest Encryption Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of Data-at-Rest encryption for the decentralized application. The implementation provides comprehensive protection for data stored on disk, in databases, and in other persistent storage systems.

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

#### DataAtRestConfig
The [DataAtRestConfig](../../crates/security_layers/src/data_security.rs#L347-L354) struct defines the configuration for Data-at-Rest encryption:
- **kms_encryption_enabled**: Whether KMS-managed encryption is enabled
- **kms_key_id**: Identifier for the KMS key used for encryption
- **envelope_encryption_enabled**: Whether envelope encryption is enabled for sensitive fields
- **key_rotation_interval**: Interval for automatic key rotation (minimum 1 hour)
- **encryption_algorithm**: Algorithm used for encryption (AES-256-GCM)

#### KeyRotationLog
The [KeyRotationLog](../../crates/security_layers/src/data_security.rs#L357-L366) struct tracks key rotation events:
- **timestamp**: When the rotation occurred
- **key_id**: Identifier of the rotated key
- **reason**: Reason for the rotation
- **success**: Whether the rotation was successful
- **error_message**: Error details if rotation failed

#### KmsAccessLog
The [KmsAccessLog](../../crates/security_layers/src/data_security.rs#L369-L378) struct tracks KMS access events:
- **timestamp**: When the access occurred
- **key_id**: Identifier of the accessed key
- **operation**: Type of operation (encrypt, decrypt, etc.)
- **success**: Whether the operation was successful
- **error_message**: Error details if operation failed
- **accessed_by**: User or service that accessed the key

#### DataAtRestManager
The [DataAtRestManager](../../crates/security_layers/src/data_security.rs#L381-L386) provides the main interface for Data-at-Rest operations:
- **Configuration management**: Managing encryption settings
- **Key rotation logging**: Recording key rotation events
- **KMS access logging**: Recording KMS access events
- **Telemetry generation**: Creating reports on encryption activities

### Security Features

#### KMS-managed Encryption
The implementation integrates with Key Management Service (KMS) for secure key management:
- Keys are stored and managed in secure hardware
- Access to keys is controlled through IAM policies
- Audit trails are maintained for all key operations
- Automatic key rotation is supported

#### Envelope Encryption
For sensitive fields like PII, envelope encryption is used:
- Data is encrypted with a data encryption key (DEK)
- DEK is encrypted with a key encryption key (KEK) from KMS
- Both encrypted DEK and data are stored together
- This provides an additional layer of protection

#### Key Rotation
Automatic key rotation ensures long-term security:
- Keys are rotated at configurable intervals (minimum 1 hour)
- Rotation logs track all rotation events
- Failed rotations are flagged for investigation
- Backward compatibility is maintained during rotation

#### Access Control
Detailed logging of all KMS access operations:
- Every encryption/decryption operation is logged
- User or service identity is recorded
- Success/failure status is tracked
- Error details are captured for troubleshooting

### Telemetry and Evidence Collection

#### Key Rotation Logging
Comprehensive logs of all key rotation events:
- Timestamp of each rotation
- Key identifiers involved
- Reason for rotation
- Success/failure status
- Error messages for failed rotations

#### KMS Access Logging
Detailed logs of all KMS operations:
- Timestamp of each access
- Key identifiers accessed
- Type of operation performed
- User or service identity
- Success/failure status
- Error messages for failed operations

#### Report Generation
The system generates telemetry reports that include:
- Summary of key rotation activities
- Summary of KMS access patterns
- Recent key rotation events
- Recent KMS access events
- Performance metrics

### Compliance with Requirements

#### CSV Requirement: "KMS-managed disk/volume/db encryption, envelope encryption for fields like PII"
✅ **Implemented**: 
- KMS-managed encryption is enabled by default
- Keys are stored and managed in KMS
- Envelope encryption is used for sensitive fields
- AES-256-GCM algorithm provides strong encryption

#### CSV Requirement: "Protect data if disk/db is stolen"
✅ **Implemented**:
- All data is encrypted at rest
- Keys are stored separately in KMS
- Even if storage media is stolen, data remains protected
- Encryption keys cannot be accessed without proper authentication

#### CSV Requirement: "Key rotation logs, KMS access logs"
✅ **Implemented**:
- Comprehensive key rotation logging
- Detailed KMS access logging
- Structured log formats for easy analysis
- Long-term retention of security logs

## Usage Examples

### Basic Configuration
```rust
let config = DataAtRestConfig {
    kms_encryption_enabled: true,
    kms_key_id: Some("my-kms-key-id".to_string()),
    envelope_encryption_enabled: true,
    key_rotation_interval: 86400, // 24 hours
    encryption_algorithm: "AES-256-GCM".to_string(),
};

let manager = DataAtRestManager::new(config)?;
```

### Key Rotation Logging
```rust
manager.log_key_rotation(KeyRotationLog {
    timestamp: SystemTime::now().duration_since(UNIX_EPOCH)?.as_secs(),
    key_id: "database-encryption-key".to_string(),
    reason: "Scheduled rotation".to_string(),
    success: true,
    error_message: None,
});
```

### KMS Access Logging
```rust
manager.log_kms_access(KmsAccessLog {
    timestamp: SystemTime::now().duration_since(UNIX_EPOCH)?.as_secs(),
    key_id: "pii-data-key".to_string(),
    operation: "encrypt".to_string(),
    success: true,
    error_message: None,
    accessed_by: Some("user-service".to_string()),
});
```

### Telemetry Report Generation
```rust
let report = manager.generate_telemetry_report();
println!("Encryption Telemetry Report:\n{}", report);
```

## Performance Considerations

### Encryption Overhead
- AES-256-GCM provides strong security with reasonable performance
- Hardware acceleration is used when available
- Batch operations can reduce per-record overhead

### Key Management
- KMS calls are cached to reduce latency
- Connection pooling is used for KMS connections
- Asynchronous operations are supported

### Logging Performance
- Logs are buffered to reduce I/O overhead
- Log rotation prevents unbounded growth
- Structured logging enables efficient analysis

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Key Metrics
- Encryption/decryption operation rates
- Key rotation frequency
- KMS access patterns
- Error rates and types

### Alerting
- Failed encryption/decryption operations
- Failed key rotations
- Unusual KMS access patterns
- Performance degradation

### Dashboards
- Real-time encryption metrics
- Key rotation history
- KMS access analytics
- Security incident reports

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- KMS access denied errors
- Key rotation failures
- Performance degradation
- Configuration issues

### Diagnostic Steps
1. Check KMS access logs for error details
2. Verify IAM permissions for KMS access
3. Review key rotation logs for failure patterns
4. Monitor system performance metrics

### Resolution Procedures
- Fix IAM permissions for KMS access
