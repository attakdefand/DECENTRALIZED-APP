| Aspect            | dApp (Decentralized Application)                                                         | Decentralized Storage (IPFS/Filecoin/Arweave, etc.)                                     |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Core purpose      | Execute **logic** and manage **state/settlement** under a consensus (smart contracts).   | Persist **data** across a distributed network with content-addressing and replication.  |
| Trust model       | Trust the **chain** (validators/miners) to run code deterministically.                   | Trust the **storage network** to retain and return the exact bytes (often with proofs). |
| What runs where   | On-chain contracts (Solidity/Vyper/etc.) + off-chain services (indexers, APIs, keepers). | Off-chain peer network; hashes (CIDs) may be **anchored on-chain** to prove integrity.  |
| Data/state        | Authoritative state (balances, orders, votes) is **on-chain**; large media off-chain.    | Raw bytes (images, JSON, blobs) stored by hash; chain stores only the **hash**/URI.     |
| Examples          | Uniswap, Aave, Lens, ENS, Perp protocols, DAOs.                                          | IPFS, Filecoin, Arweave, Sia.                                                           |
| Typical dev stack | Smart contracts + wallets + AA + indexers + UI.                                          | Gateways/pinners, CID management, pin audits, replication policy.                       |
| How they interact | dApp writes/reads **hashes** pointing to off-chain assets, proves integrity on-chain.    | Storage provides the data backbone (NFT metadata, UI assets, proofs) for dApps.         |

**Bottom line:** a **dApp** is the full application (logic + UX), while **decentralized storage** is a **data layer** many dApps use.

# 2) dApp vs **Decentralized Store (Marketplace/Storefront)**

(Here “store” means **marketplace**—a shop that lists, sells, or trades items peer-to-peer.)

| Aspect                | dApp (general)                                                           | Decentralized Store / Marketplace (specific kind of dApp)                          |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Scope                 | Any decentralized application (finance, identity, gaming, social, etc.). | A **commerce**-focused dApp: lists items, handles bids/buys/settlement on-chain.   |
| Smart-contract domain | Varies (AMM, lending, voting, identity…).                                | Listings, escrow, auctions (English/Dutch/FBA), royalties, payouts.                |
| Data model            | Protocol-specific state & events.                                        | Catalog (on/off-chain), orders, offers, receipts, payouts, fees.                   |
| Storage use           | Optional.                                                                | Commonly stores item metadata/media on IPFS/Arweave; hashes anchored on-chain.     |
| Examples              | ENS, Compound, Perps, governance portals.                                | OpenSea-like marketplaces, NFT stores, RWA marketplaces, decentralized app stores. |

**Bottom line:** a “decentralized store” (marketplace) is **one type of dApp** centered on buying/selling with on-chain settlement and (usually) decentralized storage for assets.

## Quick decision guide

* If you’re asking about **data durability and integrity**: you want **decentralized storage** (with on-chain hash anchors).
* If you’re asking about **building the product** users interact with: you want a **dApp** (which may include a decentralized **storefront** module and use decentralized storage behind the scenes).

## How they fit in your stack

* **Contracts:** marketplace (listings, bids, escrow, royalties)
* **Storage:** item metadata/media → IPFS/Arweave; store **CID hash on-chain**
* **Indexers & APIs:** fast search/filter on listings/offers/sales
* **UI:** wallet connect, slippage/fee disclosure, receipts
* **Security & tests:** CEI, reentrancy guards, royalty math, auction correctness, storage integrity (CID parity), pin coverage
