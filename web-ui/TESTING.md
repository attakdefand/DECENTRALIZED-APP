# Web UI Testing Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the testing strategy for the Web UI component of the DECENTRALIZED-APP project. The web-ui is built with Rust using the Yew framework and compiled to WebAssembly.

## Test Categories

### 1. Unit Tests

Unit tests are written using `wasm-bindgen-test` and cover individual components and services.

#### Component Tests
- PoolCard component rendering
- Navigation component routing
- OrderTable data display
- MarketChart visualization

#### Service Tests
- API client HTTP methods
- Pools service data fetching
- Orders service operations
- Markets service integration

#### Router Tests
- Route path matching
- Navigation between pages

### 2. Integration Tests

Integration tests verify that components work together correctly.

#### API Integration
- End-to-end API calls
- Error handling
- Data transformation

#### Routing Integration
- Page navigation
- URL handling
- Route parameters

### 3. End-to-End Tests

E2E tests simulate real user interactions.

#### User Flows
- Browsing liquidity pools
- Viewing order history
- Analyzing market data
- Executing trades

## Test Execution

### Running Unit Tests

```bash
wasm-pack test --headless --firefox
```

### Continuous Integration

Tests are automatically run in the CI pipeline:
- On every pull request
- Before merging to main branch
- During release builds

## Test Coverage Goals

- 80%+ code coverage for critical components
- 100% coverage for API service layer
- Comprehensive routing tests
- Cross-browser compatibility testing

## Performance Testing

### Load Testing
- Simulate multiple concurrent users
- Measure page load times
- Test API response times

### Browser Compatibility
- Firefox
- Chrome
- Safari
- Edge

## Security Testing

### XSS Prevention
- Input sanitization
- Output encoding
- Content Security Policy

### Authentication
- Session management
- Token handling
- Access control

## Monitoring and Observability

### Error Tracking
- Client-side error reporting
- Performance metrics
- User behavior analytics

### Logging
- Structured logging
- Error context
- Debug information

## Test Data Management

### Mock Data
- Sample pool data
- Test order records
- Market price history

### Test Environment
- Isolated test database
- Mock API endpoints
- Controlled test scenarios

## Test Automation

### CI/CD Integration
