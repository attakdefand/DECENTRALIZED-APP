# OPA/Cedar Policies

This directory contains the Open Policy Agent (OPA) and Cedar policies used for authorization and access control in the DECENTRALIZED-APP project.

## Policy Structure

### Policy Categories

1. **Repository Access Policies**
   - Control access to code repositories
   - Define branch protection rules
   - Manage pull request requirements

2. **Infrastructure Access Policies**
   - Control access to cloud resources
   - Define network security rules
   - Manage service account permissions

3. **Data Access Policies**
   - Control access to sensitive data
   - Define data classification rules
   - Manage encryption requirements

4. **Application Policies**
   - Control user access to application features
   - Define role-based permissions
   - Manage API rate limits

## Policy Format

Policies are written in the Cedar policy language, which provides:

- Human-readable syntax
- Type safety
- Fine-grained access control
- Integration with AWS IAM

## Policy Deployment

### Development Process

1. **Author**: Policies are authored in this directory
2. **Test**: Policies are tested using the policy test suite
3. **Review**: Policies are reviewed by the security team
4. **Deploy**: Policies are deployed through the CI/CD pipeline

### Testing

Policies are tested using the OPA/Cedar test framework:

```bash
# Run policy tests
cargo test -p policies

# Validate policy syntax
cedar validate --policies policies/
```

## Policy Enforcement

### Runtime Enforcement

Policies are enforced at runtime using the Cedar authorization engine:

1. **Request**: Access requests include principal, action, and resource
2. **Evaluation**: Cedar evaluates the request against policies
3. **Decision**: Allow or deny decision is returned
4. **Logging**: All decisions are logged for audit purposes

### CI/CD Gate

All policy changes must pass the following CI/CD gates:

1. **Syntax Check**: Policies must pass syntax validation
2. **Unit Tests**: All policy tests must pass
3. **Security Review**: Changes must be reviewed by security team
4. **Bundle Signature**: Policy bundles must be signed

## Policy Versioning

Policies follow semantic versioning:

- **Major**: Breaking changes to policy semantics
- **Minor**: New policies or non-breaking enhancements
- **Patch**: Bug fixes and minor updates

## Audit and Compliance

### Policy Audit Logs

All policy decisions are logged with:

- Timestamp
- Principal (user/service)
- Action requested
- Resource accessed
- Decision (allow/deny)
- Reasoning

### Compliance Reporting

Regular compliance reports are generated:

- Policy coverage metrics
- Access pattern analysis
- Violation reports
- Compliance status

## Security Considerations

### Policy Security

1. **Least Privilege**: Policies follow the principle of least privilege
2. **Regular Review**: Policies are reviewed quarterly
3. **Version Control**: All changes are tracked in version control
4. **Access Control**: Only authorized personnel can modify policies

### Secure Deployment

1. **Signed Bundles**: Policy bundles are cryptographically signed
2. **Immutable Storage**: Policies are stored in immutable storage
3. **Rollback**: Quick rollback capability for policy issues
4. **Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of policy enforcement
