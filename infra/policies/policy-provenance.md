# Policy Provenance

This document describes how policy bundles are created, signed, and deployed in the DECENTRALIZED-APP infrastructure.

## Overview

Policy provenance ensures that all policy-as-code implementations can be traced back to their source, verified for authenticity, and tracked through their deployment lifecycle. This provides accountability and security for policy enforcement.

## Policy Bundle Creation

### Source Control
- All policies are stored in version control systems
- Changes to policies require pull requests
- Code reviews are mandatory for policy changes
- Policies are tagged with version numbers

### Policy Development
- Policies are developed using established templates
- Policies follow consistent naming conventions
- Policies include documentation and examples
- Policies are tested before deployment

### Bundle Generation
- Policy bundles are generated from source policies
- Bundles include metadata about the source policies
- Bundles are versioned and timestamped
- Bundles include checksums for integrity verification

## Policy Signing

### Signing Process
- All policy bundles are digitally signed
- Signing is performed by authorized personnel
- Private keys are stored in secure hardware (HSM)
- Signing process is logged and audited

### Certificate Management
- Code signing certificates are used for policy signing
- Certificates are rotated regularly
- Certificate revocation lists are monitored
- Certificate validity is verified during deployment

### Signature Verification
- Signatures are verified during policy deployment
- Verification failures prevent policy deployment
- Verification is logged for audit purposes
- Failed verifications trigger security alerts

## Policy Deployment

### Deployment Pipeline
- Policies are deployed through automated pipelines
- Deployment requires approval from authorized personnel
- Deployment process is logged and audited
- Rollback procedures are available for failed deployments

### Environment Promotion
- Policies are tested in development environments first
- Policies are promoted to staging after testing
- Production deployment requires additional approvals
- Environment-specific configurations are managed separately

### Deployment Validation
- Deployed policies are validated after deployment
- Policy functionality is tested in each environment
- Policy performance is monitored
- Policy compliance is verified

## Policy Tracking

### Version Tracking
- All policy versions are tracked in a registry
- Version history includes author, date, and changes
- Policy dependencies are tracked
- Policy deprecation is managed

### Change Management
- All policy changes are documented
- Change impact is assessed before deployment
- Change approval is required
- Change rollback procedures are documented

### Audit Trail
- All policy activities are logged
- Logs include user, action, time, and result
- Logs are retained for compliance purposes
- Logs are protected from tampering

## Security Controls

### Access Control
- Access to policy signing keys is restricted
- Access to deployment pipelines is controlled
- Role-based access control is implemented
- Least privilege principle is applied

### Monitoring
- Policy deployment activities are monitored
- Anomalous activities trigger alerts
- Security events are investigated
- Incident response procedures are followed

### Vulnerability Management
- Policy vulnerabilities are identified and addressed
- Security patches are applied promptly
- Vulnerability scans are performed regularly
- Security advisories are monitored

## Compliance

### Regulatory Requirements
- Policies comply with applicable regulations
- Compliance is verified during policy development
- Compliance reports are generated regularly
- Compliance violations are addressed promptly

### Industry Standards
- Policies follow industry best practices
- Security frameworks are implemented
- Standards are reviewed regularly
- Compliance with standards is documented

## Tools and Technologies

### Version Control
- Git is used for policy source control
- GitHub is used for code review and collaboration
- Branch protection rules are enforced
- Pull request templates are used

### Build Tools
- Custom tools are used for policy bundling
- Automated testing frameworks are used
- CI/CD pipelines are implemented
- Deployment automation tools are used

### Security Tools
- HSMs are used for key storage
- Code signing tools are used for policy signing
- Security scanning tools are used
- Monitoring and alerting tools are used
