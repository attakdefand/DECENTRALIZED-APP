# Policy Gatekeeping

This document describes the testing approach for verifying policy-as-code implementations.

## Overview

Policy-as-code enables the definition and enforcement of security and compliance policies through code. Proper testing ensures that policy decisions are traceable and that policy bundles maintain their provenance.

## Key Components

### Allow/Deny Lists
- IP allow/deny lists
- Domain allow/deny lists
- Entity allow/deny lists

### Rate Classes
- Rate limiting policies
- Quota management
- Token bucket implementations

## Testing Approach

### OPA (Rego) Tests
1. Test policy evaluation logic
2. Verify decision traceability
3. Validate policy updates

### Cedar Tests
1. Test Cedar policy evaluation
2. Verify partial evaluation
3. Validate policy composition

### Partial Evaluation Checks
1. Test partial policy evaluation
2. Verify policy optimization
3. Validate decision caching

## Test Scenarios

### Policy Evaluation
- Test policy decision outcomes
- Verify traceability of decisions
- Validate policy composition
- Test policy conflicts

### Bundle Management
- Test policy bundle creation
- Verify bundle signing
- Validate bundle deployment
- Test bundle updates

### Rate Limiting
- Test rate limit enforcement
- Verify quota management
- Validate token bucket behavior
- Test burst handling

## Tools and Techniques

### Testing Frameworks
- OPA testing tools
- Cedar policy testing frameworks
- Policy simulation environments

### Security Tools
- Policy analysis tools
- Decision traceability systems
- Bundle validation tools

### Validation Methods
- Policy coverage analysis
- Decision outcome verification
- Performance benchmarking

## CI Gate Requirements

- Policy test suite must pass
- Signed bundles must be verified
- No policy enforcement gaps
